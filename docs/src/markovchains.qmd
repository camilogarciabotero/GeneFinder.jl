## DNA as a Markov chain

Several packages (e.g. [MarkovChainsHammer](), [Markovians](), etc.) in the Julia ecosystem have been implemented to work with Markov chains with a *state space* of integers, those could be efficient in many ways, but they are clumsy to work with a specialized biological types as in the `BioJulia` ecosystem. Therefore, in the `GeneFinder` package we dedicated some implementations to work with `BioSequence` types so that we can expand the functionality in an efficient way (see complete [API]()).

One important step towards many gene finding algorithms is to represent a DNA sequence as a Markov chain. In this representation a DNA sequence of a reduced alphabet $\mathscr{A} = \{A, C, G, T\}$ is draw as a four-vertex graph, where each letter of $\mathscr{A}$ is a *state (vertex)* and the edges of the graph represent *transitions* from one nucleotide to another in a sequence (e.g. $A \rightarrow T$ represent a single nucleotide to nucleotide transition). This is also considered more specifically as a Discrete Markov chain [@axelson-fisk2015]. The complete set of transitions and states of a DNA sequence of alphabet $\mathscr{A}$.

More formally a Markov chain is a random process where each state is a random variable `X_t` where `t \in T` is a discrete time in a finite sequence $T$ and the probability to jump from one state into another is *only dependent of the current state.* Therefore a definition of this *Markov property* is given by:

``` math
\begin{align}
P(X_{t} = j |X_{t−1} = i)
\end{align}
```

where $i,j \in \mathscr{A}$ . This property led us to generalize a way to calculate the probability of a sequence $T$ from a process `(X_{1}...X_{T})` where each random variable is a nucleotide from $\mathscr{A}$ so that:

``` math
\begin{align}
P(X_{1} = i_{1},...,X_{T} = i_{T}) = P(X_{1} = i_{1}) \prod_{t=2}^{T} P(X_{t} = i_{t} | X_{t−1} = i_{t−1})
\end{align}
```

Note that previous equations has two terms, a initial probability `P(X_{1} = i_{1})` and the the product of all transitions beginning at `t=2`. So, to calculate the initial probability distribution of each of the nucleotides of a string \$T\$ with the alphabet $\mathscr{A}$ we can first calculate the transition probability matrix $\mathscr{\widehat{M}}$ out of the frequency count of the transitions. In an alphabet $\mathscr{A}$ we got $4^2$ transitions of one order, that is the ${AA, AC, AG,...}$ which coincides with the frequency of the dinucleotides in the sequence. So we can later in fact build a $4x4$ matrix representing all the transitions. For instance in a DNA sequence $T$ of $24$ nucleotides:\

```math
CCTCCCGGACCCTGGGCTCGGGAC
```

We can calculate each frequency nucleotide to any other nucleotide $\widehat{m}_{ij} = \frac{c_{ij}}{c_{i}}$ where $c_{ij}$ is the actual count of the dinucleotide, and therefore $c_{i}$ is the counts of the nucleotide $i$ to any other nucleotide and build the transition probability matrix:

```math
\begin{bmatrix}
   & \text{A} & \text{C} & \text{G} & \text{T} \\
\text{A} & 0.00 & 1.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\
\text{C} & 0.00 & 0.56 & 0.22 & 0.30 \\
\text{G} & 0.25 & 0.12 & 0.62 & 0.00 \\
\text{T} & 0.00 & 0.67 & 0.33 & 0.00 \\
\end{bmatrix}
```

It is noteworthy that initial probabilities can also be obtained from the counts of each nucleotide transitions $c_{ij}$ over the total sum of the dinucleotide counts $c_{k}$ :

```math
\widehat{\pi}_{i} = \frac{c_{i}}{\sum_{k}c_{k}}
```

That way for the previous example example we can can calculate the inital probabilities $\widehat{\pi} = (0.08, 0.43, 0.34, 0.13)$. Both set of probabilities composed a *transition model* that can be used to predict the probability of any sequence using equation (2).

##  Transition models with BioSequences

We can now calculate a transition matrix from a `LongDNA` sequence using the `transition_probability_matrix` and `initial_distribution` methods for a given `LongDNA` sequence:\

```{julia}
using BioSequences, GeneFinder

sequence = dna"CCTCCCGGACCCTGGGCTCGGGAC"

tpm = transition_probability_matrix(sequence)
initials = initial_distribution(sequence)

println(tpm)
println(initials)
```

More conveniently, we can now use the `transition_model` method and obtain the transition probabilities and the initial distribution and build a transition model:

```{julia}
transition_model(sequence)
```

Note that, sometimes the dinucleotides transition do not harbor important biological meaning, whereas trinucleotides or codons are, in fact, the building block of proteins. Therefore, sometimes the transition model we want to build is usually a second-order Markov chain, that represents the possible transitions of a trinucleotide.

A very nice nice property of the transition probability matrix is that the *n-step transition probability matrix* $\mathscr{M}^{n} = (\mathscr{m}_{ij}(n))\$, that is the $n$th power of $\mathscr{M}$ represents $i \rightarrow j$ transitions in $n$ steps. We can also have higher order transition models as:

```{julia}
transition_model(sequence, 2)
```
